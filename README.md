# Soul Injector

Offline firmware downloader for ARM Cortex-M, on an ESP32-S3.

## To-do list - Major building blocks

- [ ] SWD on SPI Master, instead of bit-banging
- [ ] "Unlimited" buffering (write firmware chunk to RAM cache while the target is busy committing cache to flash)
- [x] Run flash algorithm (done in v0.0.1)
- [x] Offline firmware flashing (done in v0.0.1)
- [x] More (manual) tests (done in v1.0.0)
- [x] Read verification (done in v1.0.0)
- [x] Desktop app: see [huming2207/soul-composer-app](https://github.com/huming2207/soul-composer-app) (done in v1.0)
- [x] USB CDC-ACM communication (done in v1.0.0)

## To-do list - other platforms except Cortex-M & SWD

- [ ] ESP32 Bootloader UART firmware downloading 
- [ ] GD32VF103 RISC-V, over JTAG??
- [ ] CH32VF103 RISC-V, over SWD/cJTAG?

## Post-MVP feature list

- [ ] Basic BLE functionality
- [ ] Compression on BLE transmission
- [ ] OCD server over BLE?
- [ ] USB DAP-Link probe? (but why not buy one from Taobao instead?)
- [ ] Abandon CMSIS-Pack's flash algorithm, move to my own impl of flash algorithm (to get it even faster)
